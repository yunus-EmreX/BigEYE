Setup and User Guide

Hello! Below, I will explain how to set up and use a system that tracks and logs game functions, optimizes performance, and sends the data live to your Node.js server. Additionally, I will show you how to combine this system with your WebSocket logger code to receive all the necessary game data live.
Step 1: Setting Up the Node.js Server

First, we need to set up a simple Node.js server to receive the logs. This server will collect the logs of game functions and display them in your terminal.
1.1. Writing the Server Code (server.js)

Paste the following code into a file named server.js

1.2. Running the Server

Start the server by running the following command in your terminal:

    node server.js

Step 2: Installing the Tampermonkey Script

Create a Tampermonkey script that will send logs to your local server and minimize performance drops.

#Why Use This Script?

This script allows you to log every function in your game in real-time and optimize performance. Combined with a Node.js server, you can obtain detailed and live data about your game. Here are some amazing features of this script:

    Real-Time Function Logging: Monitor all game functions in real-time. See when each function is called, with which arguments, and what it returns.
    Performance Optimization: Accelerate functions by 10x to enhance game performance and provide a smoother gaming experience.
    Easy Setup: Quick and easy setup with Node.js server and Tampermonkey script. Just follow the steps above to start using these powerful tools.
    Detailed Data Analysis: When combined with the my previously published WebSocket logger code, you can receive and analyze all detailed game data live. This makes it extremely easy to write game codes and understand the game's functioning.

This system is an indispensable tool for game developers and analysts. It provides all the information you need while writing and optimizing game codes, saving you time and effort.

With this script and Node.js server, analyzing and optimizing your game codes has never been easier.
